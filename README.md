<!-- Plugin description -->
Git Churn

This plugin provides a Git Churn analysis:
- How often a file has been changed since the specific time
- Color the most changed files

Git Churn helps you to decide which files to focus on during the refactoring process.
The less a file changes, the easier it is to understand the code.
